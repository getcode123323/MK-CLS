"Still needs work The biggest flaw is the toggle between flag and clear mine is not clear enough. When the toggle is in flag mode, the button is lightly outlined in blue - almost impossible to see in bright conditions due to iPad reflections. And barely discernible in ideal conditions.  The second big flaw is the screen to play a new game swishes through at lightening speed in a catch-me-if-you-can chase every 4-6 games.  Finally, the ads seem to get more and more distracting as time goes by. Increased motion flying around the field of vision making difficult to use the app for MY intended purpose - to play the game. It is particularly difficult when working at the lower edge of the puzzle, as the field of play can no longer be moved to a more comfortable visual distance from the more nauseating ads.  I understand the ads are how the developer gets paid, but at the point when the ads are so overwhelming that the player shuts the game off instead of continuing to play, everybody loses: player, developer, and sponsor.",2,2,1,0,1,1,1,186,0,0,"Minesweeper Reloaded",1,1

It has failed to play some tracks but there is sure to be another version among my 40,000 tracks. Editing is a breeze and changes can be saved! Great as a Karaoke machine and great for midi backing tracks. But while playing, editing and flicking between screens it vanished? Still playing the track with a BLACK screen and no response. This happened more than once on different tracks? This is on a Galaxy s4 LTE with Snapdragon 800 and Android 4.4 Kit Kat so they dont come much more powerful than that yet. It gets a bit hot with intensive play but most of us have a backup or resort to an unplugged set.

Apparently again, I need an Xperia phone to do that, which doesnt seem correct, as Google Fit tracks my activity just fine both on my watch and my Nexus5.I hope to see less restrictions in future versions of Lifelog, and embrace the Google apps more.

" Also, there is another issue that happens regardless of the device used: the automatic night mode comes in even if you are walking in the street, therefore if you forget to manually switch it back to day mode (with the danger to forget to switch back to night when you go to bed) it appears as sleep time during which you are awake and does not count your burnt calories during all that time. I think it should detect when you are awake and moving and better adjust automatically the set night/day mode accordingly. But that maybe depends more on the smartband device than on the application.That has another danger: that you manually turn the day mode on at night , and then forget to switch it back to night when you go to bed: then it does not register you as asleep even though there is no motion for hours. Maybe it should automatically return to night mode when you are not moving and it is within that time frame that you set as night automatically. In fact, the instructions say it automatically adjusts night/day according to your motions besides the automatically set hours, but it doesnt do that, or at least it doesnt do it during the night time. It seems to do that only when you wake up in the morning it goes to day time mode even if its still within the hours set as night in the automatic night setting.Other than that, Im enjoying the smartband features.",0,2,1,0,0,1,1,253,0,0,"lifelog_beta",1,1

" Hello. Happy to attend another beta, lets listen to the users as well as the professionals and keep it constructive. My main concerns at this point is the functionality of the app if you put it up against the move maker from the older generations. From the start I simply missed the feature to not automatically generate those movies at all since not all my photos are good memories, but still very important to keep for later reference. I love the features added to the beta, but it seems like I cant choose how mutch of a clip I want or how long each photo is on for. I absolutely love that you now can remove and change what goes on the move, and that you can select music is priceless. I have used quite a few video editors for computers, but there is no reason I cant use this app for my rather simple musicvideoes in the future if a few things gets a bit refined. Like for music selection you can set start point, but only to the closest second. I understand that eventually this feature will be available for videos, but if you can set points with greater accuracy lipsync would be within range. I understand that my needs are a bit outside normal, but one thing that I think everyone would enjoy would be to decide whether or not the audio from the videos are playing and maybe volume. I am yet to realy put it to the test, but I have used the app from the beginning, but never really enjoyed any of the movies until the beta features where added. Got to admit my life is rather tragic, but highlights from my life will be totally awesome when I can remove some of the not so bright moments since my phone is yet to understand witch captured moments I find beautiful and truly can be remembered as a highlight from my life",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,329,0,0,"movieCreator_beta",1,1

" I just joined this beta program and I stressed a bit the application: what I like most is the possibility to play most of the recognised songs on Spotify. I have the premium there and Im not interested in using other platforms. However roughly 40% of songs played (from spotify) didnt had the link to spotify, which is kinda weird because I was playing them from... Spotify, on PC.Also, i found the recognition strong in particular on classical music if compared with other platforms (I mean, those software are NEVER good enough on classical, but I made a selective comparative with Google music search, shazam and soundcloud, and TrackID is the best one right now), but weak in everything else. Its weakness is particularly evident in movies soundtracks when there was no way to have recognised songs about ultra famous movies and authors, like Morricone, Zimmer and Tiersen. Even with indie music (always available on spotify, only tracks with rating >40000) it has serious issues. No problem with famous rock and pop songs. Expecially with pop songs its lightning fast, but the song has to be very mainstream. I suggest the killer feature could be a way to train it, like the possibility to give it a link with the source it wasnt able to recognise. (maybe from filtered sources, like Google play music or spotify, to avoid the risk to learn from a low quality content).(I personally developed a similar system for patent data mining and contextual search, and after 1 year of development without significant improvements, giving it the patent and make it learn from the source it wasnt able to discover was the best solution to improve the performance). Anyway, I personally appreciate the ease to use and the interface. Im sure it has the potential to become one of the best software out there, but it still need a lot of work.I hope my small feedback could be helpful.",0,2,1,0,1,1,1,324,0,0,"trackID_beta",1,1

Would it be making a come back?I liked how apps were linked together, like PS Video, My Videos and TV Side View. It meant that you could open one app, mainly for video entertainment and be able to access all things related without to much hassle. I stream from my NAS be it on to phone, but can in the same app quickly minimise the screen and jump into Side View to control the TV if needs be! The linking of apps is something that I think is a really great feature for ease of use, rather than having to close and navigate to to another app. Basically jumping back and forth. For this reason I have reverted back to the standard Video app. But hopefully these features will make a return in the BETA 9.4, and I will join the program again.",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,165,1,1,"video_beta",0,1
